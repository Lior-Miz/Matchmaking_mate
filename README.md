## 🌟 Project Overview

This application serves as a bridge between players. Unlike generic social networks, Matchmaking Mate focuses specifically on gaming preferences, allowing users to filter potential friends based on the games they play (e.g., Fortnite, FIFA, GTA V).

### Key Functionalities:
* **Smart Matching:** Filters users based on specific game selections.
* **Live Communication:** A real-time chat system powered by Firebase Realtime Database.
* **Social Graph:** Ability to send friend requests, accept/decline matches, and view profiles.
* **Secure Environment:** Full authentication system (Sign Up/Login) to ensure user privacy.

## 📱 App Flow & User Journey

Here is how the application works from the user's perspective:

1.  **Onboarding:** The user creates an account using their email and password. During sign-up, they select their favorite games to build their gamer profile.
2.  **Discovery:** On the home screen, the user can search for other players. The system filters the list to show relevant matches based on the selected games.
3.  **Connection:** By clicking on a user, the full profile is displayed. The user can then choose to "Add Friend".
4.  **Interaction:** Once connected, users can start a private chat, exchanging messages instantly.
